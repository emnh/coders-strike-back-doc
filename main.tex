\begin{abstract}
\noindent Coders Strike Back is a multiplayer coding game on CodinGame \citep{codingame}.
The players each control a team of two pods during a race.
As soon as a pod completes the race, that pod's team is declared the winner.
The circuit of the race is made up of checkpoints.
To complete one lap, your vehicle (pod) must pass through each one in order and back through the start.
The first player to reach the start on the final lap wins.

The map is 16000 units wide and 9000 units high.
Let's create a sample map with some checkpoints.
We'll use this for example calculations.

\draw (0,-1.5) -- (0,1.5);
\draw (0,0) circle [radius=1cm];
